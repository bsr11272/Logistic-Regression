## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on input features. It is widely used in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and marketing. This project aims to provide a clear and concise implementation of Logistic Regression without using any external libraries, allowing users to understand the underlying concepts and details of the algorithm.

## Dependencies

This implementation requires the following dependencies:

- Python 
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

You need to provide your own dataset in a suitable format for binary classification. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before using it with this implementation. The dataset should be split into training and testing sets for evaluating the model's performance.

## Implementation Details

The implementation of Logistic Regression includes the following key components:

- Sigmoid function: This function maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the positive class.
- Cost function: The cost function calculates the difference between the predicted and actual values and is optimized using gradient descent.
- Gradient descent: This iterative optimization algorithm updates the model's parameters to minimize the cost function.
- Training loop: The training loop performs multiple iterations of gradient descent to find the optimal parameter values for the model.

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results can be visualized using plots or tables to provide a better understanding of the model's behavior.
